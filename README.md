# PlayYourWay
Tired of getting dumb contracts that you feel obligated to complete? Well, this may be the mod for you.

Play Your Way removes ALL stock contracts, and frees up your imagination to explore the way you see fit. 
Thats not all though! Play Your Way also awards you **REP** and pays you **FUNDS** based on any science points you accumulate while you explore. 

Also, how much you get paid is completely up to you!

Want to get paid 1,000 FUNDS for every science point you collect? You got it! 500 REP for every science point you collect? Go for it!
just make the necessary changes in the cfg.



ENJOY!
